###### Complete
Click the 'Save' button to complete your timetable. Click 'Export URL' to post your data to the URL so you can bookmark it and import it if it disappears.
### Backing up / Importing
There are two options for backing up your data.
1. Exporting to the URL. This is the easiest option as it allows you to simply bookmark the page with the data saved in the URL.
2. Exporting to text. This turns your data into a line of text that you can save in a txt file to come back to if your data disappears.

To import your data, click on the 'Edit Timetable' button and click either 'Import URL' or 'Import TXT' depending on your choice of backing up.
